# Doing Leetcode

Each directory contains my description, thought process, and learnings from a Leetcode problem, with also the implementation (usually in Python). Sometimes done while pairing with other Recursers.

I find it to be a useful way to ensure that I learn something from the problem, writing the doc (sometimes a day or so later) forces me to reflect.

I try to do this for one Leetcode problem per Leetcode session, and usually for the hardest one I did during that session (often at the "Medium" level at the moment).
